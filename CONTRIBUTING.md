## CVDP Benchmark Contribution Rules

#### Issue Tracking

* All enhancement, bugfix, or change requests must begin with the creation of a [CVDP Benchmark Issue Request](https://github.com/your-org/cvdp_benchmark/issues).
  * The issue request must be reviewed by CVDP Benchmark maintainers and approved prior to code review.


#### Coding Guidelines

- Avoid introducing unnecessary complexity into existing code so that maintainability and readability are preserved.

- Try to keep pull requests (PRs) as concise as possible:
  - Avoid committing commented-out code.
  - Wherever possible, each PR should address a single concern. If there are several otherwise-unrelated things that should be fixed to reach a desired endpoint, our recommendation is to open several PRs and indicate the dependencies in the description. The more complex the changes are in a single PR, the more time it will take to review those changes.

- Write commit titles using imperative mood and [these rules](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/), and reference the Issue number corresponding to the PR. Following is the recommended format for commit texts:
```
#<Issue Number> - <Commit Title>

<Commit Body>
```

- Ensure that the build log is clean, meaning no warnings or errors should be present.
- All components must contain accompanying documentation (READMEs) describing the functionality, dependencies, and known issues.

  - See `README.md` for existing benchmarks and tools for reference.

- To add or disable functionality:
  - Add configuration options with default values that match the existing behavior.
  - Use feature flags or configuration files where appropriate.
  - Document any new configuration options in the relevant documentation.

- Make sure that you can contribute your work to open source (no license and/or patent conflict is introduced by your code). You will need to [`sign`](#signing-your-work) your commit.

All CVDP Benchmark Open Source Software code should contain an NVIDIA copyright header that includes the current year.  The following block of text should be prepended to the top of all OSS files.  This includes .py and any other source files which are compiled or interpreted.

#### Pull Requests
Developer workflow for code contributions is as follows:

1. Developers must first [fork](https://help.github.com/en/articles/fork-a-repo) the [upstream](https://github.com/your-org/cvdp_benchmark) CVDP Benchmark repository.

2. Git clone the forked repository and push changes to the personal fork.

  ```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_FORK.git cvdp_benchmark
# Checkout the targeted branch and commit changes
# Push the commits to a branch on the fork (remote).
git push -u origin <local-branch>:<remote-branch>
  ```

3. Once the code changes are staged on the fork and ready for review, a [Pull Request](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-pull-requests) (PR) can be [requested](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-pull-request) to merge the changes from a branch of the fork into a selected branch of upstream.
  * Exercise caution when selecting the source and target branches for the PR.
    Note that versioned releases of CVDP Benchmark are posted to `release/` branches of the upstream repo.
  * Creation of a PR kicks off the code review process.
  * At least one CVDP Benchmark maintainer will be assigned for the review.
  * While under review, mark your PRs as work-in-progress by prefixing the PR title with [WIP].

4. The PR will be accepted and the corresponding issue closed only after:
   - All tests pass
   - Code review is completed and approved
   - Documentation is updated if necessary
   - The changes have been adequately tested by the developer and/or CVDP Benchmark maintainer reviewing the code.


#### Signing Your Work

* We require that all contributors "sign-off" on their commits. This certifies that the contribution is your original work, or you have rights to submit it under the same license, or a compatible license.

  * Any contribution which contains commits that are not Signed-Off will not be accepted.

* To sign off on a commit you simply use the `--signoff` (or `-s`) option when committing your changes:
  ```bash
  $ git commit -s -m "Add cool feature."
  ```
  This will append the following to your commit message:
  ```
  Signed-off-by: Your Name <your@email.com>
  ```
